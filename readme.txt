Display information about the default category via a shortcode

== Description ==
This is a simple plugin that you may need.

It allows you to display information about the default category via the [lh_display_default_category] shortcode.

By default this shortcode will output the name name of the default category but if you wish to output any of the wordpress category object keys you can output them instead by specifiying the key e.g. [lh_display_default_category key="category_count"]

This plugin actually supports other taxonomies (that have default term support). So you can also us it like so: [lh_display_default_category taxonomy="my-custom-taxonomy"]

In time I will add gutenberg support for this plugin

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is something does not work?  =

LH Logged In Post Status, and all [https://lhero.org](LocalHero) plugins are made to WordPress standards. Therefore they should work with all well coded plugins and themes. However not all plugins and themes are well coded (and this includes many popular ones). 

If something does not work properly, firstly deactivate ALL other plugins and switch to one of the themes that come with core, e.g. twentyfifteen, twentysixteen etc.

If the problem persists pleasse leave a post in the support forum: [https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-display-default-category/](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-display-default-category/). I look there regularly and resolve most queries.
